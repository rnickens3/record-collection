# Adjusting a Record Collection
## This project demonstrates:
* Objects and properties
* The push method
* Conditional logic with if statements

## How it Works
1. This function will check many statements and change the record accordingly
2. The user should be able to add and remove properties
3. The result will display in a message

## What I Learned
This project tested my ability to create a function with several statements that adjusts properties of an object. This could be done with bracket or dot notation. I chose to do so with brackets.
